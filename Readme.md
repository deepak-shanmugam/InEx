> About this project

BETA version released! Almost all the functionalities will work in this release. very simple and faster to use with useful exiting features that can be available from command line itself. You can analyse all your income and expenses by using a simple and very useful 'filter' command. 

Available commands (ignoring command arguments): create , open , remove , list, add , edit , delete , view , filter, info, save, close, quit, about, help 

use 'help' command to know more about each command and its arguments. Alternatively you can check the same by viewing appInfo.c file itself.

The objective of this project is to develope a compact and simple command based Income and Expense tracking application in C language. I have been trying to develope this with a much better implementation practises (stability, security, scalability and readability) as of my current skill. Because I was not satisfied with my previous 2 similar discontinued projects (InEx-plus and InEx-app) due to lack of better implementations and poor implementation respectively, even though it just works. However, there is a significant improvement in the implementation of this project in all aspects compared to the previous ones. 

Note: Some os oriented or device oriented issues were identified. A new version of this application will soon arrive with much better implementation!
